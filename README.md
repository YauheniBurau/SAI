Strong fast self studying Artificial intelligence
in development, pre-alpha

in development
1. png-file -> graph<...>
1.1 List of graph<...> -> find Consistent image patterns of contours and save in Graph with VertexTerms 
1.2 save any graph<...> into file
1.3 load from file -> Graph<...>
1.4 test
1.5 enter testImage
1.6 testImage -> graph<...>
1.7 find VertexTerms in testImage and output results
2) audio-file ->graph<...>
List of graph<...> -> find Consistent audio patterns and save in Graph with VertexTerms 
save sound graph<...> into file
load from file -> sound Graph<...>
test
enter testSound
testSound -> sound graph<...>
find VertexTerms in testSound and output results
3) enter time connectedData like letters with pronounsiation
find VertexTerms in connectedData and output results
find Consistent patterns between sounds and images.

test enter sound data and get image letters analog
test enter image letters data and get audio analog
